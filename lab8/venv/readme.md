There is circles.py module (see below) which has some errors.

You have to run mypy with provided above mypy.ini configuration file. Try to fix all errors by
adding type annotations for variables, functions, and classes. Repeat this "run - fix" cycle until
mypy shows no errors.

Then, run python circles.py and correct code if there are some errors. After, feel free to send
the result for the review.

Acceptance criteria are both the module works without errors and mypy shows no errors.
